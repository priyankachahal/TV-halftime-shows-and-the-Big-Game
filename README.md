# TV-halftime-shows-and-the-Big-Game

The notebook demonstrates a small data camp project.

The dataset used in this project was scraped and polished from Wikipedia(provided by data camp). It is made up of three CSV files, one with game data, one with TV data, and one with halftime musician data for all 52 Super Bowls through 2018.

Tasks included:

What are the most extreme game outcomes?
How does the game affect television viewership?
How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved over time?
Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?
